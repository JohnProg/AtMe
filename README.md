@Me is a simple and lightweight messaging application for iOS, written entirely in the Swift programming language. 
We aim to provide a reliable and ad-free open source communication platform to better connect the world. 


## Features

- [x] Impressively fast text and picture messaging
- [x] Customizable profile picture, display name
- [x] Messaging caching for offline capabilities

## Coming Soon

- [ ] Support for video messaging, gifs and more
- [ ] Ability to respond to message at lockscreen
- [ ] Sharing extension for use with compatible iOS apps

## Dependencies

One of the primary goals during development was to minimize dependencies. The release version depends only on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for backend database, storage and auth, [OneSignal](https://onesignal.com/) to coordinate push notifications, and [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) to help with image caching. The UI was created from 
scratch, along with the design, app icons, software and overall architecture.
